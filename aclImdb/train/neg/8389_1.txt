So thatÂ´s what I called a bad, bad film... Poor acting, poor directing, terrible writing!!!! I just canÂ´t stop laughing at some scenes, because the story is meaningless!!! DonÂ´t waste your time watching this film... Well, I must recognize it has one or two good ideas but itÂ´s sooooo badly writen...
