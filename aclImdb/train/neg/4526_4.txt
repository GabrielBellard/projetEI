Rather foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type mystery-thriller, improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology and based on the Robin Cook novel; incidentally, Iâve recently acquired another adaptation of his work â COMA (1978) â in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) â a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his so-far impressive career would not recover.<br /><br />Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast, however, this one proved a critical and commercial flop â mainly because the narrative just isnât very thrilling: in fact, itâs quite dreary (feeble attempts at horror â the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment, rotting corpses galore, and even an attack by a flurry of bats â notwithstanding). Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure â itâs actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the countryâs heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long. Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot, and pays for this âact of treasonâ with his life.<br /><br />Typically, it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be â so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw at London in early 2007 in a West End performance of âFrost/Nixonâ, which has now been turned into a film) goes from Downâs antagonist to her lover and back again, as he determines to keep the wealth belonging to Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.
