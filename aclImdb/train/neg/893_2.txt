When I bought this DVD I though: "It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standardsÂ let's give it a chanceÂ" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring, and leads nowhereÂ It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or another directionÂ The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80'sÂ The acting should have been better tooÂ Well, to sum up, it's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years! Bad argument, bad acting, bad productionÂ I had no high hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I've ever imagined! Just forget about it!
