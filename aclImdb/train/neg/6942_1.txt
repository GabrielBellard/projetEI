This thing is really awfull. ThereÂ´s no charachter with weight, theyÂ´re all floating around in the BGÂ´s. The Motion Capture is a fine toy, but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film. THE MACHINE CANÂ´T DO ANYTHING WELL BY ITSELF. If you see it as a bizarre film, youÂ´ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity... IN A 3D MOVIE!!! ItÂ´s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data-entries whom know 3D programs. Note the junctions, like the elbows, how they lost volume and get deformed. The person who made the charachter design (a very good one) sufered for sure when he/she watched them move, Â´cos you canÂ´t say they come to life.
