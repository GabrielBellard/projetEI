I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to FulciÂ´s Classic "Zombi".<br /><br />So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else thereÂ´s nothing.<br /><br />I didnÂ´t expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value. The director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) itÂ´s time to learn something more.<br /><br />In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore - for me thatÂ´s not enough - sorry.<br /><br />** out of *****
