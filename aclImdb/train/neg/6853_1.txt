Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim ThomersonÂ´s 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy, too: Note how ThomersonÂ´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad, but thatÂ´s why we watch these movies, ainÂ´t it? Sequel Â´Dollman Vs. Demonic ToysÂ´ is reportedly even worse, if thatÂ´s possible.<br /><br />0 (of ****)<br /><br />
