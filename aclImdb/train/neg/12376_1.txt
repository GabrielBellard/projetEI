This collection really sucks!<br /><br />I rented it, thinking IÂ´d really would enjoy some good fighting. Man this sucked! Quick flashy cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened (IÂ´m thinking especially of Jet LiÂ´s fight in Fists of legend and Jackie ChanÂ´s fight from drunken master 2).<br /><br />And whatÂ´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters?! WhatÂ´s so "cool" about that? IÂ´ve seen more interesting fights on Martial Law!<br /><br />This a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people.<br /><br />Do not ever buy this film! Do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap!<br /><br />Instead, go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory!
