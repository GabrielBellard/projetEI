This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film!!!! Ripstein's locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, no doubt about it. Fernando LujÃ¡n and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You must see it!!!
