"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies, IÂ´ve ever seen. I donÂ´t understand, why this movie didnÂ´t get better critics, itÂ´s funny, harmless and sweet. I first watched it, when I was 11, and I really fell in love with it... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Till today, IÂ´ve shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. I think, thatÂ´s the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... This movie never got a real chance, thatÂ´s sad, "SI" has really the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! Even if you donÂ´t get mad about it, itÂ´s worth watching! --> Prepare to laugh, earth scum!
