Given the title, this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but thereâs no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley (though itâs unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment â though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled âThe Colonelâs Ladyâ). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), itâs still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.<br /><br />âThe Vergerâ tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) â for which the storyâs title is another word â whoâs dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because heâs illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered â and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayterâs lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were â to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! <br /><br />The second episode, âMr. Know-Allâ, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most â the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrickâs attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ârevengeâ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesnât appreciate)!; still, itâs here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character â told by Crawford that the necklace sheâs wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its priceâ¦but the latter realizes immediately that itâs the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawfordâs position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! <br /><br />As can also be deduced from the title, âSanatoriumâ deals with the myriad patients at such a place â run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot â one humorous (the âfeudâ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naÃ¯ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a âliferâ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).
