"Hotel du Nord " is the only CarnÃ© movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques PrÃ©vert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal Saint-Martin settings.<br /><br />This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.The pimp Jouvet tells his protÃ©gÃ©e Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphÃ¨re) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphÃ¨re,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinÃ©ma:<br /><br />In French :"AtmosphÃ¨re?AtmosphÃ¨re?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphÃ¨re?" Translation attempt:"Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French "Nobody's perfect".
