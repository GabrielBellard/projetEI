This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narration, but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik LindstrÃ¶m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film really puts that on display.<br /><br />"Vuxna mÃ¤nniskor" (Adult People) is a warm-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood, and the question if we wouldnÂ´t be better off without it.
