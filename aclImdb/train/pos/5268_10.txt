The barbarians maybeÂ´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen, but really????........ItÂ´s so funny......I canÂ´t discribe how mutch I laughed when I first saw it..The director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but itÂ´sso misirable bad....so bad that itÂ´s one of the funniest movies IÂ´ve ever seen......so my advise is that you should see it.....and if you alredy did, se it again!!!!!!!
