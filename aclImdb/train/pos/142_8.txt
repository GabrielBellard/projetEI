Second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one, but has plenty of laughs and scares as well. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, as the monster baby and his demon-like father. Other standout parts this time are SÃ¸ren PilmarkÂ´s Doctor Krogshoj, who must face the horrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, and once again, patient Mrs. Drusse tries to solve the mysteries, Miss Marple-style. Ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors Ernst Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you wonder how theyÂ´re ever going to be able making Part III, but I hope Von Trier will give it a shot. Sadly, Morten Rotne Leffers, the DownÂ´s Syndrome dishwasher #2, died shortly after, as well. Look for Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd in a cameo. ***
