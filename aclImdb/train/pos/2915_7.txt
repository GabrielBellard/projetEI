Bunny Comes Home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than it gets, a clever script by Borden Chase, directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman, the film has just the right feel for early post WW11 euphoria and goodwill, and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later. Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated, the battle scenes a little dÃ©jÃ  vu, Tom Drake's melancholy attraction for radiant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, plays real and validates Drake's career at Metro. The following year Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel.' Wally Beery, a little bleary-eyed, boasts to an always incredulous Jimmy GleasonÂ his memories an improvement over reality, and give Beery a Ulysses-like shadow to play against. The Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) shots are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is out of March AFB. Lot 3 doubled for India, and Bunny's U-turnÂ Bunny Comes HomeÂ gives back to Beery an authentic slice of his past, something he had wanted to believe was trueÂ then, the future we spin into again is fantasticalÂ now on a grander scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance planeÂ how expensive, blissfully optimisticÂ still, "You got to believe in it, that's the way you make things come trueÂ"
