One of the ten best comedies ever <br /><br />This seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings. Keaton's comedies are _innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought.<br /><br />Wonderfully amusing, deliberately delightful and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one. A threefold love story will enchant the viewers; I want to bring here this approachÂKeaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upsideÂdownÂor Ã REBOURS. Again a couple traverses the waters of timeÂand of epochsÂin the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's timesÂin a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in the both moviesÂone, a grim, eerie melodrama; --the other, a light, virtuouslyÂpaced comedy. At Keaton it's essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice. I have found THREE AGES well written and smart, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very POPEYEÂlikeÂthe babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivalsÂKeaton and Beery.<br /><br />Keaton's movie is simply enormously likable, and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funÂyet it's not, but it is grand fun, large fun, ample fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.
