The remarkable, sometimes infuriating, often brilliant films of John Cassavetes occupy a unique position in American cinemaÂ Low-budget, partly improvised, inspired by cinÃ©ma veritÃ© documentary, and related to underground film, they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audienceÂ <br /><br />After drama studies, the young Cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually unrefined, intense actor, often appearing in films about disaffected, rebellious youth such as "Crime in the Streets" and "Edge of the City." <br /><br />Setting up an actors' workshop, he worked to transform an improvisational experiment into his feature debutÂ The result, "Shadows," taking three years to complete and partly financed by his performances in TV's Johnny Staccato, was a breakthrough in American cinemaÂ About the effect of racism on an already fraught relationship between two black men and their sister, two of whom pass for white, the film is impressive for its irregular, seemingly formless style and naturalistic performancesÂ Plot was minimal, mood and emotional apparent truth were everythingÂ
