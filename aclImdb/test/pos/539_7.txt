itÂ´s a movie to see on tv and only once.. i mean, itÂ´s good, but itÂ´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known, it isnÂ´t very original but it isnÂ´t boring. the best thing of the movie are the performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job. i give it a 7.
