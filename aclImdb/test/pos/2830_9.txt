I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that Peck ever did; daring , surprising and one of his few best westerns (--no, no, of course, not a western really, but a military chronicle, which sometimes is better--). It's quite lowÂbudget, but, oh, very original and striking. It's one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets; movies that no one yet told you they exist. You sayÂ'that sounds intriguing, or interesting'Âand it surpasses your expectations.<br /><br />All in all, the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the westernsÂand it somehow reminded me, obliquely, of ULZANA; it's also straight noÂnonsense suspense.<br /><br />Peck looked dashing as a young and tough, somewhat gloomy and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected touchesÂlike the blonde babe kissing and flirting with the one she's decided not to marry, perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and retribution Â.<br /><br />Even genreÂwise, ONLY Â is so much more than a military taleÂit is as well an action drama, a suspense movie, a commando/ action thrillerÂthe weirdest combo imaginable; a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible Native's attack Â--the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those Natives could be stoppedÂbut only a handful of people Â--and this plot never takes a crap routeÂas most would and did Â. The interest for humans, for people and their reasons and actions never falters.<br /><br />A due word about Peck himself; he performs with brio, and though I usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring, in such small outings I find intact all Peck's somber and even chilling glamor. He was an unusual star.<br /><br />I gladly recommend this extraordinary movie.
