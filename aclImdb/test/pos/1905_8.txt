Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ã buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70Ãs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the TitanicÃs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style thatÃs a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong. This is one to watch over and over againÃafter you put the kids to bed.
