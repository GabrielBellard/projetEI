I have seen 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it. The actors of the movie are wonderful (specially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought that BelÃ©n Rueda would have a better role. Lola DueÃ±as, Clara Segura and, specially, Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I cannot forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist).<br /><br />There are two technical aspects I loved very much: Aguirresarobe's photography and the score by AmenÃ¡bar himself. I liked the song, 'Negra sombra' ('Dark Shadow'), by Luz Casal with music of Carlos NÃºÃ±ez.<br /><br />In short, I think that the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' in order to compete in the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions, such as AlmodÃ³var's 'Bad Education', but AmenÃ¡bar's film is much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards.
