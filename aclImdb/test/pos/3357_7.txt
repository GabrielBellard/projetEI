A lovely librarian, played by Playboy model Kristine DeBell, falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely uninhibited peopleÂ These people love to sing and dance and fool aroundÂ Alice has a series of sensual adventures among these charactersÂ <br /><br />The film was originally shot as a poem to eroticism with few explicit sex scenes, which were eventually cut from its theatrical releaseÂ Videocassette versions, however, have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with themÂ <br /><br />For an extremely low-budget picture, the producers of this film did an extremely good jobÂ The cinematography is full of life and energy, the dances and numbers quite professional, and the acting lovableÂ Without a doubt, it is one of the best adult fairy tales aroundÂ
