IÂ´ve been able to see this great movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I went out of the cinema I felt like being drugged down *g*! IÂ´ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few IÂ´d call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people watching it in Berlin went out of the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life! I donÂ´t think I have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page! ItÂ´s a movie that shows everything and more!!! Gets 10 points + from 10!!! ItÂ´d be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e-mail!So far I havenÂ´t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as I am!!! Finally sorry for my bad english-IÂ´m not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so!!! :-))))))
