'It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'<br /><br />Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage coupleÂ Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endÂan act never before attempted by a womanÂ <br /><br />At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his lifeÂ <br /><br />The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die aloneÂ <br /><br />As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to himÂ In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being thereÂ Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrowÂ They are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with themÂ <br /><br />In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identityÂ Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptionalÂcarrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of soulsÂ When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tearsÂ She asks him to visualize her as he diesÂ ''I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''Âin that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for himÂ
