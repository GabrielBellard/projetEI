I missed it at the cinema and have rented it on DVD. If you get the chance I would recommend it as itÂ´s better than nearly everything IÂ´ve seen at the cinema or on DVd this year. That isnÂ´t to say itÂ´s one of the best films ever or anything, itÂ´s just IÂ´ve seen a lot of rubbish :)<br /><br />CanÂ´t really add to whatÂ´s already been said except 8/10
