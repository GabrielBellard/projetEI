Crazy Six is torture, it must be Albert PyunÂ´s worst film. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I canÂ´t believe how boring this film is! How this even got greenlighted? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. This isnÂ´t good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.<br /><br />1 out of 10 (Â½ out of *****)
