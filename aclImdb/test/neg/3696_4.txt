Iâd been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the Worst Film Ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci-fi cinema in a British periodical from the early 1980s entitled âThe Movieâ (incidentally, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the unenviable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I became interested in purchasing the âCult Camp Classicsâ Box Set in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); however, since recently acquiring QUEEN on DVD-R, I had put paid to the idea.<br /><br />Happily, Iâve just stumbled upon the film on DivX â however, the print wasnât culled from the Warners DVD (which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer) but rather a muddy TV printâ¦though not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black-and-white!). Anyway, to get to the matter at hand: I have to admit that, in a way, I was disappointed the film didnât prove to be the laugh-fest I had anticipated all this time (Maltin calls it âhilariously awfulâ); actually, I found it quite engaging â and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length. Some undeniably amusing bits remain though â such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the Sheriffâs deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading ladyâs butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case. Neither did the special effects hit me as being âamong the funniestâ (Maltin again) on film â though theyâre certainly embarrassingly bad! <br /><br />O.K., so the idea that an alien (in giant-sized human form, clad in cave-man rags, and radioactive to boot!) coming to Earth in a big ball-shaped(!) spaceship and apparently after the heroineâs prized necklace is utter nonsense â and his quasi-transparent appearance does it no favors at allâ¦but, really, itâs the human story that holds our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the philandering husband isnât very interesting, but his two women are: wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and ambitious, vixenish girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative are Hayesâ faithful servant (already mentioned), a couple of cops (one of them, as noted elsewhere, being amiably goofy) and as many doctors (one of whom is named Dr. Cushing[!] and another a specialist whoâs called in when Hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation).<br /><br />Of course, the film could be seen as the reversed female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) â though it wouldnât be fair to compare the two further, as the Jack Arnold/Richard Matheson classic is far more psychological/intellectual in approach; actually, Hayes doesnât seem to be that bothered with her âconditionâ and, in fact, takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson! However, her rampage â exaggerated in movie posters of the era â is rather quaint (especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand (especially when lifting the puppet thatâs supposed to be her husband!), sheâs mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind (with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by)!! Still, Hayesâ demise via electrocution (when she bumps into an electrical cable) is competently done.<br /><br />Finally, I followed this with its 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature â which I rented specifically for this purpose.
