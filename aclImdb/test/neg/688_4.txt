Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) â which Iâve watched several years back â Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]). Iâd previously watched the pretty good âEuro-Cultâ effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and, apart from this, Iâve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check â one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production â featuring American and Italian actors and a British director â which was prevalent during the 1960s; itâs harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong â especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.<br /><br />The gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) â the others are a âpacifistâ black man, a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except heâs destituteâ¦but, under the auspices of âProfessorâ Robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollarsâ worth of platinum! Needless to say, the gang members donât trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco â where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the Italian canât resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days â however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! <br /><br />The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, âtakeâ the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done, he fully intends to double-cross De Sica â but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this, so heâs forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime didnât pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the planeâs bomb-bay doors are accidentally openedâ¦
