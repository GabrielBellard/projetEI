I kind of like JAG. It do have itÂ´s charm but lately itÂ´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.<br /><br />I donÂ´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.<br /><br />I still watch the show, so itÂ´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and donÂ´t save the world in the future.
