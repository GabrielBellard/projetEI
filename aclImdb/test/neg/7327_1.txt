A study in BAD. Bad direction, bad acting, bad writing and f/x thatÂ´ll teach you that youÂ´d better upgrade your computer before filming. ItÂ´s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with DadÂ´s camera when you were young at heart. But YOU certainly would not show it in public when youÂ´re sober again, would you? YOU wouldnÂ´t even view it. Avoid at all costs.
