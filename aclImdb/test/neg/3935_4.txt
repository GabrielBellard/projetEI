The obsession of 'signifie' and 'signifiant' is not enough to make a good film. Pascal Bonitzer should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film theorist back in the '60Â´s. It was not necessary to take the camera. The result is quite frustrating. ItÂ´s a pity for his excellent leading actors.
