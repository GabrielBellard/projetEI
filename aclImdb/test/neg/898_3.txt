I did not quite get Barnens O Â it is one of the weirdest ones I have watched. The soundtrack was quite unusual as well Â written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another one instead Âat times the movie seemed plain dumb to me, or boring Â or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in that movie Â trough they too are kind of messed up . Probably the only phrase that I will remember out of it is going to be "When you are alone, you can control things "Â and "I will show them "- or something like that .The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up Â "the last summer as a child "he thought once Â and he sure lived it to the max. So if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie Â but you won't miss much if you don't.
