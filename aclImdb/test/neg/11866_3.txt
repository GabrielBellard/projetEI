Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1 Â Cheap looking villains. 2 Â Perfectly timed one-liners. 3 Â Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4 Â The hero hooking up with the hot chick. 5 Â Multitudes of nude or scantily clad women for no reason. OK so I lied, it covers those but does so horribly.
