This movie has been promoting in everywhere in Spain with a huge publicity campaign, after watching it, you realise that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is horrible as Carmen, sheÂ´s not natural at all and she looks like sheÂ´s making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots ("the best" is when she as an andalusian woman ...Â¡can speak basque and fluentlyÂ¡, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her as Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot donÂ´t work, and the screenplay is really very very bad...I think Penelope Cruz (the film was written for her)would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen.<br /><br />What a waste of time and money
