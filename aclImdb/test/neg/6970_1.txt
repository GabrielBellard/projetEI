Considering the filmâs reputation as truly the worst of the worst, I was looking forward to watching Woodâs Crappus Opus (my word); itâs not necessarily any more inept than the other Woods Iâve watched â however, being from the REEFER MADNESS (1938) school of film-making, GLEN OR GLENDA doesnât come across as readily âenjoyableâ as his genre efforts.<br /><br />Also, this surely emerges as Horror legend Bela Lugosiâs nadir (his first of three âcollaborationsâ with the director): one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was (considering the actorâs history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo). Besides, Lugosiâs idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward hereâ¦though Woodâs script is mostly to blame for this â given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to âpuppy-dog tailsâ and âbig fat snailsâ) he handed the ailing star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) â and, being just as worthless in this area, proves to have been an all-round dog!; Dolores Fuller â his wife and co-star â was similarly untalented (she would also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954])â¦but, at the very least, the image where the latter finally lets Glen wear her angora sweater did give Tim Burtonâs affectionate biopic ED WOOD (1994) its famous poster! <br /><br />Incidentally, the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between Wood and Orson Welles â well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes Ed Woodâs CITIZEN KANE (1941) given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques: in fact, the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore (many of it irrelevant, such as the bewildering instances of S&M) and inane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese weep with envy)! The filmâs sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction/phenomenon of transvestism is, however, sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach.<br /><br />For what itâs worth, the edition I watched was the âExtended Re-issue Versionâ which included six minutes of âdepravedâ footage (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored on original release! Furthermore, my copy went out-of-synch every so often (which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track) â though, thankfully, this was the fault of the source conversion to DivX as opposed to the film itself.
