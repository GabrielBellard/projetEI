ItÂ´s long time that I and my wife didnÂ´t see such a boring thriller. ItÂ´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really donÂ´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.
